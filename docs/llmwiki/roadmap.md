# Roadmap

## Immediate Next

### Y-06A Dockerless desktop distribution feasibility audit

- Run a Level 3 feasibility audit for Dockerless desktop distribution.
- Scope: Windows + macOS, local-only personal use.
- Make beginner-friendly UX planning the source of truth for this phase.
- Do not implement packaging, installers, signing, updater logic, backend
  changes, frontend changes, Docker changes, CI changes, or package/lockfile
  changes in Y-06A.

## Beginner UX Source Of Truth

Y-06 should optimize for a non-developer local desktop user:

- Start MeTube without understanding Docker.
- Keep setup language short, Japanese, and concrete.
- Prefer one clear local launch path per OS.
- Make storage location, app status, and stop/quit behavior obvious.
- Avoid public hosting, account setup, ads, background sync, or external-user
  assumptions.
- Preserve the existing readonly update readiness work as diagnostic support,
  not as update execution.

## Future Automatic Update Stages

Y-05 readiness work is complete for now. These remain historical or candidate
stages, not approved update execution work:

- Stage 1: readonly version/status visibility (implemented)
- Stage 2: local changelog and update availability confirmation
- Stage 3: backup and rollback design (documented)
- Stage 4: readonly backup / rollback readiness preflight report (implemented)
- Stage 5: manual approval flow for applying updates (documented)
- Stage 6: dry-run / prepare-only update apply contract (documented)
- Stage 7: readonly update-plan contract-only endpoint (implemented)
- Stage 8: readonly update-plan runtime verification (completed)
- Stage 9: optional readonly plan/preflight UI visibility or closeout decision
- Stage 10: guarded local-only update execution

Any automatic update stage must respect the safety boundaries in
`safety-boundaries.md`.

## Future UI Improvement Candidates

- Improve clarity of Japanese status and error copy
- Make local-only state visible without adding public hosting assumptions
- Improve update-status footer presentation after runtime verification
- Keep UI changes separate from backend, Docker, and CI changes unless a task explicitly
  requires a broader scope

## Not In Scope Now

- Public hosting
- Ads or monetization
- Mass-download optimization
- External wiki tooling
- Background daemons or automatic sync
- Update apply implementation
- Desktop installer or packaging implementation
